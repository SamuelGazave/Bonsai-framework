  "body": "**Hi i'm Samuel.**\r\n\r\nIn my curent job i build a lot of e-mail campaigns and as html email can be tricky, i built a tool to help me create solid templates and newsletters very fast. It comes with a grid system and pre-built elements i use the most in my creations in order **to help graphic designers to easily create mobile friendly designs**. \r\n\r\n##strengths##\r\n\r\n1. The grid Helps graphic designers to understand how heir creation will behave on mobile devices. Coders can also use it to quickly slice the PSD files graphic designers gives them.  \r\nAs i cann see most of the time, those who create e-mails on photoshop are not allways those who code them (most of the designers who sends me PSDs design for print but have very few web design understanding).  \r\nThis tool helps everyone working together to get a better result on responsive e-mail design.\r\n\r\n2. The HTML is separate from the CSS. It allows me to easaly maintain a graphic chart on a large collection of templates linked to the CSS file.  \r\nFor example, when changing from winter to summer collection, i just have to change colors or type styles into the CSS file and my entire collection is up-to-date.  \r\nThis is also a good way to have a typographic constancy within my e-mail collection as i set the differnt styles in the CSS before apply the correpondant classes in my HTML.\r\n\r\n3. Using an inliner to mount e-mails is a good way to avoid errors when coding. It allows me to manage links, alt or title tags in a HTML file free from any style and when it's done, the inliner gets all my css inline for me. I can't forget anything and my e-mail is good to go.\r\n\r\n##Weaknesses##\r\n\r\nWhen an e-mail is broken, it usualy is because of theses points :\r\n\r\n1. Outlook conditionnal comments width don't match the actual size of the columns. I have to pay attention to this each time i have to work on an e-mail but when i forget, the error is easy to find and repair.\r\n\r\n2. The size in the whidth tag of  an image don't match the size it must have in a column with padding applied arround it. it causes Outlook to display the image shorter or wider than it should be. It is also an error easy to find and repair.\r\n\r\n\r\n#The grid#\r\n\r\nThe structure of the e-mail is made of a table container. Inside of this table, i have stages with the class row  \r\n   \r\n`\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"row\">\r\n - columns goes here -\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n`  \r\ninside the rows, each column is a div surrouded by conditionnal comments for Outlook like this:\r\n\r\n`\r\n<tr>\r\n                        <td class=\"row\">\r\n                            <!--[if (gte mso 9)|(IE)]>\r\n                            <table width=\"600\">\r\n                            <tr>\r\n                            <td width=\"300\" valign=\"top\">\r\n                            <![endif]-->\r\n                            <div class=\"col2\">\r\n                                <table width=\"100%\">\r\n                                    <tr>\r\n                                        <td class=\"inner10 contents-center modulespacer\" style=\"background-color:#f292ad; border:1px solid crimson;\">\r\n                                            col2<br><span class=\"modulespacersmall\">300px</span>\r\n                                        </td>\r\n                                    </tr>\r\n                                </table>\r\n                            </div><!--[if (gte mso 9)|(IE)]></td><td width=\"300\" valign=\"top\"><![endif]--><div class=\"col2\">\r\n                                <table width=\"100%\">\r\n                                    <tr>\r\n                                        <td class=\"inner10 contents-center modulespacer\" style=\"background-color:#f292ad; border:1px solid crimson;\">\r\n                                            col2<br><span class=\"modulespacersmall\">300px</span>\r\n                                        </td>\r\n                                    </tr>\r\n                                </table>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <!--[if (gte mso 9)|(IE)]>\r\n                            </td>\r\n                            </tr>\r\n                            </table>\r\n                            <![endif]-->\r\n                        </td>\r\n                    </tr>\r\n`\r\n",
