I created a grid to help graphic designers adapt their work to the needs of reponsive e-mail creation and made the all thing work as a framework.

Coders can also use it to create various layouts in a small amount of time with the use of the grid and pre-built elements.

## How it works

HTML and CSS comes into separates files so HTML is lighter when you are creating the e-mail. The CSS contains all the class you need from the grid to the style element. This allows you to change the width of a column or the style of a button simply by changing the class applied to the HTML element.

For example, i have made diffrent class in my CSS to style my typographic elements that are .h1 .h2 .h3 .h4 etc...

if i want to change my heading from .h4 to .h1, i just have to change the class into the <td> like this :
