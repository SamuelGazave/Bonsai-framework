# Bonzail-framework
A framework for e-mail design based on the fluid-hybrid method by Nicole Merlin

https://github.com/SamuelGazave/Bonzail-framework.git

I created a grid to help graphic designers adapt their work to the needs of reponsive e-mail creation. and made the a framework like some kind of bootstrap.
Coders can also use it to create various layouts in a small amount of time with the use of the grid and pre-built elements.

thanks to Nicole Merlin for this exellent tutorial.
